Predicting Heart Failure Using MachineÂ Learning

Every year cardiovascular diseases kill millions of people worldwide. They are disorders of heart and blood vessels and are divided into heart attacks (caused by occlusion of heart vessels), strokes (caused by occlusion or breakages of brain vessels), and heart failure (caused by the inability of the heart to pump enough blood to the body). Since severe heart failure can lead to patient death, it is very important to predict it in advance based on the patient's clinical and laboratory data.
